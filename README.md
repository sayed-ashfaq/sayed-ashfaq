## Hi there 👋
### 👨‍💻 Resume
📄 You can know more about myself and my contribution in [My Resume](https://github.com/sayed-ashfaq/sayed-ashfaq/blob/main/Sayed-ashfaq-DS-Resume.pdf)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **LangChain-powered GenAI project** that acts as a smart morning productivity assistant. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with tools like **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **prompt engineering**, and **task automation**. The goal is to build an AI system that can deliver personalized knowledge updates, manage to-do lists, and support daily goal tracking—all through natural language. I'm focusing on integrating **OpenAI, LangChain, and vector databases** to make the assistant context-aware and responsive.
